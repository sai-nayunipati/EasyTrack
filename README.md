# EasyTrack

This project is inspired by the app "Coursicle". It is meant to allow Boston University students to "track" classes to receieve an email notification when seats open up. This helps them register for highly-booked sections. Currently, the code scrapes public endpoints to populate a MySQL database with course data and availability. In the future, I will implement an email-notifier and registration page for users.
